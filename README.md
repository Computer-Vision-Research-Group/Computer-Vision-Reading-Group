# About the reading group
Welcome to the space for the Computer Vision Reading Group, hosted by the [Computer Vision Research Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/computer-vision) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield! 

Our group convenes to explore cutting-edge research, discuss pivotal papers, and delve into emerging trends in CV. Involved topics may include, but are not limited to, object detection, semantic segmentation, medical image analysis, generative AI, foundation models, and multimodal learning.

The events will normally take place every three weeks from 4 PM to 5 PM, on Wednesdays, at Ada Lovelace (108) meeting room.

The slides and recordings will be shared at internal [Google Drive space](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1o3_ADeVKSqumyZjem81fHtKCu-Cl2qWl).

We welcome students and academic staff from various groups and departments who share a genuine interest in advancing their understanding of this dynamic field, as well as those who are willing to help others advance their knowledge beyond their own progression.
Please [email me](mailto:sli256@sheffield.ac.uk) if you are willing to propose and deliver a presentation. You can do it either with or without a partner.
